                "05We will sit down and wait. We might wait for a few minutes, or we might wait for a long time. While I am waiting, I can read a book, check out the fish tank, or sit quietly. {{PARENTS-LABEL}} can help me to find something to do while I wait.",
                "06When my name is called, it is our turn to walk back to a small room to check my height, weight, and temperature. I will meet a nurse in the room. The nurse will talk with me and ask me some questions, like my name and my birthday.",
                "07When we are finished in the small room we will walk to a different room.",

                "12Then the Doctor will look in my ears and nose with a special light. I will remember to stay still.",
                "13Then the Doctor will ask me to open my mouth so he can look inside.",
                "14The doctor will finish his exam and will talk to {{PARENTS-LABEL}} and me about my health and we will make a plan together.",
                "15Then the Doctor will say good bye. This means I am done. On the way out of the room, I can get a sticker, from the desk where we checked in, if I want to. {{PARENTS-LABEL}} and my other friends will be proud of me for doing a good job holding still and following directions!",
