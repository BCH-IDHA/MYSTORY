                "01I am going to Boston Children’s Hospital at Peabody to visit a Neurology Doctor. This story will tell me what my appointment will be like.",
                "02I will come into the lobby.",
                "03I can take the elevators or the stairs to the 2nd floor.",
                "04I will go to the waiting room through the big glass doors.",
                "05I may need to wait in line to talk with someone at the front desk to let the Doctor know I am here.",
                "06Next, I will sit in a chair and wait until my name is called. While I am waiting, I can read a book, check out the fish tank, or sit quietly.",
                "07When my name is called, it is our turn to walk back to a small room to check my height, weight, and temperature. I will meet a nurse in the room. My nurse friend will talk with me and ask me some questions, like my name and my birthday.",
                "08I will stand on the scale to see how much I weigh.",
                "09When we are finished in the small room we will be brought to another room.",
                "10Next the Doctor will come in to see me.",
                "11The Doctor will talk to my {{PARENTS-LABEL}} and me. The Doctor may ask me questions. I will do my best to answer them and if I need help my {{PARENTS-LABEL}} can help me answer.",
                "12Now it is time for the doctor to do a check up with special tools on the wall. These special tools help the doctor see my ears, eyes, and mouth.",
                "13The Doctor may look in my eyes and mouth with a special light.",
                "14The Doctor may measure the distance around my head.",
                "15The Doctor may also check my reflexes with a special tool but this doesn’t hurt.",
                "16The Doctor may ask me to walk, run or jump in the room or hallway.",
                "17The Doctor will talk with my {{PARENTS-LABEL}} and me a little more.",
                "18Then the Doctor will say good bye. This means I am done. On the way out of the room, I can get a sticker, from the desk where we checked in, if I want to."
