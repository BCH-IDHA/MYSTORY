                "01I am going to Boston Children’s at Peabody for an EEG.",
                "02On the night before my EEG, I get to stay up late and wake up very early in the morning, so that I am very tired and I can sleep during part of my test.",
                "03On the day of the EEG, I will go to the hospital with {{PARENTS-LABEL}}.",
                "04We will go in the main lobby. We will walk up the stairs or take the elevator to the 2nd floor.",
                "05When we get to the 2nd floor we will walk through the big glass doors.",
                "06Next we will walk to the front desk and stand very still while  {{PARENTS-LABEL}} tells the front desk worker we have arrived. Then we will wait until I hear someone call my name.",
                "07When it is time for my EEG, a technologist will bring us to a different room.",
                "08The technologist will have me lie down on the bed.",
                "09The technologist is the person that will help with the EEG. He/she will explain how the EEG works and then we can start!",
                "10First, the technologist will measure my head with a tape measure. I will keep my body very still.",
                "11Next, the technologist will draw dots on my head with a soft crayon to mark where the electrodes will go.",
                "12The technologist will use a Q-tip and soap to rub off the crayon dots. The soap will feel sandy.",
                "13Next, the technologist will place electrodes (small gold discs with colorful wires) on my head.",
                "14While he/she is putting the electrodes on my head, I can look at my toy or watch a movie. I can remember to stay still the whole time so the electrodes don’t move.",
                "15The technologist will use special glue and tape to help the electrodes stay in place.",
                "16After the electrodes are on, the technologist will wrap my head with soft gauze.",
                "17I will lie down on the bed and my parents can stay with me. I can sleep, look at my toy, or watch a movie during the EEG.",
                "18If it is hard for me to stay still on my own, the technologist might wrap my body in a sheet to help remind me, but this is ok. I will be safe.",
                "19The camera and computer will learn about my brain when I follow the directions. I will need to be still and calm for 30 minutes or 1 hour.",
                "20The technologist will also have blow into a pinwheel.",
                "21The technologist will ask me to look at a flashing light. He or she might ask me to open and close my eyes.",
                "22When the EEG is over, the technologist will take off the electrodes using special shampoo.",
                "23The shampoo might smell funny, but it will make my head clean again.",
                "24I am all done with my EEG. Everyone will be so proud of me for keeping my body calm and following directions.",
                "25When the EEG is all done we will take the elevators or the stairs to the 1st floor.",
                "26Then we will leave through the lobby and we can go home."
