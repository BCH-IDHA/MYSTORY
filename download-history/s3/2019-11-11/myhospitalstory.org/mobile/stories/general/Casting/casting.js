                "01I am getting a cast at Boston Childrenâ€™s Hospital. The cast will help the bone that I hurt get better and stronger again.",
                "02Someone called an Orthopedic Technician will place the cast on my arm. The technician will talk to me and my {{PARENTS-LABEL}} about the steps of getting a cast.",
                "03When I get my cast, the technician will wrap my arm with different materials.",
                "04First, the technician will measure a material called stockinette to my arm. This is a soft piece of cloth used to cover my arm to keep it clean. The technician will cut a small hole in the stockinette for my thumb.",
                "05Next, the technician will wrap a soft cast padding over the stocking. The cast padding helps support my arm and keep it comfortable.",
                "06The next material is called fiberglass. At first, the fiberglass roll is hard, but it will become soft, warm, and wet when the technician dips it in water.",
                "07The technician will wrap the wet fiberglass over the padding. It will dry after a few minutes. It might feel a little warm on my arm.",
                "08While the cast is drying, the technician might ask me to hold my arm a certain way. This will help the bones heal in the right position. I can remember to stay still while the cast is drying.",
                "09The technician might trim some of the extra padding around my hand with safety scissors.",
                "10Next, the technician might let me choose a color for my cast. If I want, I can pick my favorite color!",
                "11Once I pick a color, the technician will dip the colored fiberglass in water so it will become soft.",
                "12The technician will wrap the wet, colored fiberglass around my cast. At first it will be soft, but slowly it will harden to keep my arm nice and still.",
                "13Once the cast has dried, I can have everyone write their names on my cast to help me feel better.",
                "14The cast will stay on my arm until my bone is strong and will stay in the right place by itself. I might wear my cast for 1 or 2 months or maybe longer. Once my cast is on, I can go home. Everyone will be so proud of me for doing a great job!"
