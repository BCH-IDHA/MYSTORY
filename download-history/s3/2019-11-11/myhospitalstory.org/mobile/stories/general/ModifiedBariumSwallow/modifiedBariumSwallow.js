                "01I am getting ready for my Modified Barium Swallow Study at Boston Children’s Hospital. A Modified Barium Swallow helps the doctors to learn more about how I swallow when I eat and drink.",
                "02First, we will walk into the lobby and take the elevator to the second floor.",
                "03We will walk to the front desk and stand very still while my parent tells the front desk worker we have arrived. Then, we will wait until I hear someone say my name.",
                "04My name might be called right away or I might have to wait a little while. While I am waiting, I can play with a toy, read a book, or sit quietly. I might be hungry while I wait, but I will get to eat as soon as it is my turn.",
                "05When it is my turn, the speech therapist will call my name and bring us into a different room.",
                "06When we walk into the room, I will sit in a special blue chair.",
                "07The speech therapist will place a small blue blanket on my lap. It might feel a little heavy, but this is ok.",
                "08The room may have a lot of computer screens and people in it. There will be a camera next to me and it will take a picture of me when I swallow my snack or drink.",
                "09My parents will talk to the speech therapist while I wait in the blue chair.",
                "10My parent will stay in the room with me. They will wear a heavy shirt.",
                "11Next, the speech therapist will take my food into the kitchen to get it ready.  She will add a white powder that will help the camera take a picture of the food. I will be able to see the picture  on the computer screen when I eat the food.",
                "12When it is time to eat or drink, the camera will come down next to me so it can take pictures. My parents will give me some snack to eat and drink.",
                "13The doctor will take pictures while I eat. If I want to, I can watch the computer screen to see the food I am eating.",
                "14The drink might taste different. It might look white and taste fruity.",
                "15I only have to eat a few bites and drink a few sips of each. I can try to eat and drink a little bit of everything.",
                "16When I am done with my snack, I can get out of the chair.",
                "17My parents will talk to the speech therapist about how I am eating and swallowing. When the Modified Barium Swallow is over, I can get ready to leave.",
                "18I will get a prize at the end of the visit for doing a good job eating and drinking my snack! Everyone will be so proud of me!"
