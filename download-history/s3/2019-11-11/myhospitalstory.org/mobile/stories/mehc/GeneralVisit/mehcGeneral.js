                "03My name might be called right away or I might have to wait a little while. While I am waiting, I can do a quiet activity. The person I am with can help me find something to do.",
                "04When it is my turn, a clinical assistant, the person who tells the doctor how much I’m growing, will call my name and bring me to a room. The clinical assistant will ask my parent some questions.",
                "05The clinical assistant will measure how much I weigh. The clinical assistant will ask me to stand on a scale. Maybe I will need to take my shoes off and that’s okay. I can remember to stand very still while the clinical assistant reads the number on the scale.",
                "06The clinical assistant will also measure how tall I am. I can stand nice and tall against the wall and I might feel a tap on my head.",
                "07Then the clinical assistant will ask me to sit on a chair and she will take my blood pressure by wrapping a piece of cloth around my arm. The cloth will feel very tight but this is ok. This is to learn about how my heart is working.",
                "08Next, the clinical assistant will check my eyes to see how well I can see.  I will look at some lights and tell the clinical assistant what I see.",
                "09Then, I will have my hearing checked. I will  listen for a beep sound and raise my hand when I hear it.",
                "10The clinical assistant will bring us to another room where I will meet my nurse and doctor.",
                "11First, the doctor will talk to my parent while I sit in a chair. Then, it is time for the doctor to do a check up with special tools on the wall. These special tools help the doctor to see my ears, eyes, and mouth.",
                "12When I am all done they might have a sticker or a book for me to choose.",
