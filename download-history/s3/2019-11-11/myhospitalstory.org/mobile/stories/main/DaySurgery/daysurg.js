				"01I am getting ready for my surgery. My doctors need to do the surgery to learn about my body. They want to help me get better.",
				"02First, we will walk from the hospital lobby to the surgery waiting area on the third floor of the Main Building. We will follow the signs with the purple moon and stars.",
				"03When we see this sign, we know that we are in the right place!",
				"04On the third floor, we will talk with someone at the front desk.",
				"05The person at the desk will give me a bracelet with my name, \"{{CHILD-NAME}}\". Now the doctors will know my name while I am having surgery.",
				"06Next, we will sit until my name, \"{{CHILD-NAME}}\", is called. My name might be called right away, or I might have to wait. While I wait, {{PARENTS-LABEL}} may help me find something to do.",
				"07When my name is called, it will be time to go to a different room, called the Day Surgery Unit. A nurse will bring me and my {{PARENTS-LABEL}} to this new room.",
				"08This new room may be busy with people, like nurses and doctors. There are lots of beds, and I may see other kids waiting for surgery like me.",
				"09The nurse will ask me to stand on a scale to be measured. She will measure my height and weight.",
				"10Then, I will sit on a stretcher. The stretcher is long, and looks like a bed with wheels.",
				"11While I am sitting, the nurse will gently place something on my finger. It's called a pulse oximeter. It will measure the oxygen in my body.",
				"12Then, the nurse will take my temperature with a thermometer. The nurse might touch the thermometer to my head, or the side of my face near my ear. She might also put it inside my mouth or ear.",
				"13The nurse will take my blood pressure to learn about my heart. She will wrap a piece of cloth around my arm. The cloth will feel very tight, but that is okay.",
				"14Next, the nurse will listen to my heart and lungs with a stethoscope. The stethoscope might feel a little cold, but that is okay. This is to learn more about how my heart and lungs are working.",
				"15It's time to put on hospital pajamas! They look like a long shirt that opens in the back. If I need help, {{PARENTS-LABEL}} can assist me.",
				"16Now, I must wait for my surgery. I can take deep breaths to help me feel calm. I might also meet the Child Life Specialist, who will bring me fun activities to do.",
				"17Soon, it will be time to meet my doctors and nurses, who will take care of me during the surgery.",
				"18I will also meet my anesthesiologist, who will give me medicine to make me go to sleep for my surgery. The anesthesiologist will talk with me and my {{PARENTS-LABEL}} about which sleeping medicine is best for me. It might come through an IV . . .",
				"19. . . or through a mask like this.",
				"20My anesthesiologist might let me pick the flavor of the mask. It's fun to choose from the different flavors! If I want, my {{PARENTS-LABEL}} or doctor can decide for me.",
				"21While I wait for my surgery, I might need to take medicine to help me relax and feel sleepy. I might drink the medicine, or the nurse might use my IV to give it to me. My doctor will know which kind of medicine I need.",
				"22Once I am feeling relaxed and sleepy, my doctors and nurses will push my bed to the room where I will have my surgery.",
				"23My {{PARENTS-LABEL}} might be able to come with me. My doctor will tell them if it is okay. If my {{PARENTS-LABEL}} do not come with me, my doctors and nurses will take good care of me. I will see my {{PARENTS-LABEL}} when I wake up.",
				"24Once I am in the room for the surgery, I might need to be moved from my bed to another table. Then, I will fall asleep from the anesthesia.",
				"25When my surgery is finished, I will stop getting the anesthesia, and I will start to wake up. When I wake up, I will be in a different room with my {{PARENTS-LABEL}}. The room might be busy with doctors and nurses, who will take care of me and other kids who had surgery. I will be safe in the new room.",
				"26Before it is time to go home, the Child Life Specialist may visit. She may bring something to watch, or something to play with while I recover.",
				"27When my doctors say it is okay, I can go home! Everyone will be so proud of me for doing a great job!"
