                "01I am getting ready to have surgery at Boston Children’s Hospital to fix my heart. My parents will be with me on the day of surgery.",
                "02First, we will walk from the hospital lobby to the surgery waiting area on the third floor of the Main Building.  We will follow the signs with the purple moon and stars.",
                "03When we get to the third floor, we will talk with someone at the front desk.  I will stand still and wait nicely.",
                "04Then the person at the desk will give me a special bracelet with my name on it.  This is so the doctors will know what my name is when I am having surgery.",
                "05Then we will wait until my name is called.  My name might be called right away or I might have to wait a little while.  My parents can help me find something to do while I wait.",
                "06When my name is called, it will be time to go to a different room called Pre-Op Holding.  A nurse will bring me and my parents to this new room.  This new room may be busy with people.  I may see other kids waiting for surgery too and nurses and doctors working.",
                "07The nurse will measure how tall I am and how much I weigh.  The nurse will ask me to stand on a scale to be measured.",
                "08Then I will sit on a stretcher.  It is long and looks like a bed with wheels.",
                "09While I am sitting on the stretcher, the nurse will gently place what's called a pulse oximeter on my finger.  This measures the oxygen in my body.",
                "10The nurse will also check my temperature.  The nurse will use a thermometer.  The nurse might touch the thermometer to my head and the side of my face near my ear.  Or, the thermometer might go into my mouth or in my ear.",
                "11The nurse will also check my blood pressure by wrapping a piece of cloth around my arm.  The cloth will feel very tight by this is ok.  This is to learn about how my heart is working.",
                "12Next, the nurse will listen to my heart and lungs with a stethoscope.  This is to learn about how my heart and lungs are working.  The stethoscope might feel a little cold, but this is ok.",
                "13Then, I will put on hospital pajamas.  It looks like a long shirt that opens in the back.  My parents can help me put the hospital pajamas on if I need help.",
                "14Then I will wait for my surgery.  While I am waiting, I might meet the Child Life Specialist, the person who will bring me fun activities to do.  I can remember to take deep breaths to help me feel calm while I am waiting, or play a favorite game on my pad.",
                "15Soon it will be time to meet my doctors and nurses, who will take care of me during the surgery. I might meet lots of different doctors and nurses, but this is okay.",
                "16I will also meet a doctor, who will help me fall asleep and stay asleep during the surgery. There are lots of different ways that kids get sleeping medicine. The doctor will talk with me and my family about which one is best for me. Sometimes it might be through a small tube called an IV sometimes it might be through a mask.",
                "17When my surgery is finished the doctors will move my bed to a new room in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). My body will need lots of rest. The doctors will give me special medicine to help me sleep and have my body rest.",
                "18While I am sleeping the doctors and nurses will take good care of me. My parents will be with me too. When my body is stronger I will stop getting sleepy medicine and I will start to wake up. My parents will be in the room with me. There will be doctors and nurses around to help take care of me. This is ok. I will be safe.",
                "19When I wake up, I might notice different machines and wires. This is okay, these are to help the doctors and nurses learn about my body.",
                "20It is important that I take all of my medicine to help my body start to feel better. The medicine will help my body get stronger.",
                "21When my body is strong enough, it will be time for me to move to a new room on 8East. This room will look different. My nurse will help move my bed to my new room. My parents will come with me.",
                "22There are lots of fun things that I can do in my new room. I can take walks to the activity room, play games, watch TV, and rest. A different child life specialist might visit me. She has lots of fun things to do.",
                "23When my doctors say it is ok, I can pack up my things and go home with my parents. Everyone will be so proud of me for doing a great job!"
