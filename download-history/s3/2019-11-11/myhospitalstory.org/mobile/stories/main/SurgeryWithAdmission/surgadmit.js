                "01I am getting ready for my surgery. My doctors need to do the surgery to learn about my body or to help me get better.",
                "02First, we will walk from the hospital lobby to the surgery waiting area on the third floor of the Main Building. We will follow the signs with the purple moon and stars.",
                "03When we see this sign we know that we are in the right place!",
                "04When we get to the third floor, we will talk with someone at the front desk.",
                "05Then the person at the desk will give me a bracelet with my name on it. This is so the doctors will know what my name is when I am having surgery.",
                "06Then we will wait until my name is called. My name might be called right away or I might have to wait a little while. While I am waiting, my {{PARENTS-LABEL}} may help me to find something to do while I wait.",
                "07When my name is called, it will be time to go to a different room, called Pre Op Holding. A nurse will bring me and my caregivers to this new room.",
                "09This new room may be busy with people like nurses and doctors. There are lots of beds in here too because I may see other kids waiting for surgery like me.",
                "10Then the nurse might measure how tall I am and how much I weigh. The nurse will ask me to stand on a scale to be measured.",
                "11Then I will sit on a stretcher. It is long and looks like a bed with wheels.",
                "12While I am sitting on the stretcher, the nurse will gently place what’s called a pulse oximeter on my finger. This measures the oxygen in my body.",
                "13The nurse will also check my temperature. The nurse will use a thermometer. The nurse might touch the thermometer to my head and the side of my face near my ear. Or, the thermometer might go in my mouth or under my arm.",
                "14The nurse will also check my blood pressure. She will wrap a piece of cloth around my arm. The cloth will feel very tight but this is ok. This is to learn about how my heart is working.",
                "15Next the nurse will listen to my heart and lungs with a stethoscope. This is to learn about how my heart and lungs are working. The stethoscope might feel a little cold, but this is ok.",
                "16Then I will put on hospital pajamas. It looks like a long shirt that opens in the back. My {PARENTS-LABEL} can help me put the hospital pajamas on if I need help.",
                "17Then I will wait for my surgery. While I am waiting, I might meet the Child Life Specialist, the person who will bring me fun activities to do. I can remember to take deep breaths to help me feel calm while I am waiting.",
                "19Then it will be time to meet the doctors and nurses, who will take care of me during the surgery. They may ask me and my {{PARENTS-LABEL}} questions. We can ask them questions too!",
                "20I will also meet my anesthesiologist, who will help me fall asleep and stay asleep during the surgery. There are lots of different ways that kids get sleeping medicine. The anesthesiologist will talk with me and my {{PARENTS-LABEL}} about which one is best for me.",
                "21Sometimes it might be through an IV like this... (please see IV story if applicable).",
                "22…and sometimes it might be through a mask like this.",
                "23My anesthesiologist might let me choose the flavor of the mask. There are lots of different flavors! Some kids say it’s fun to choose a flavor. If I want, my {{PARENTS-LABEL}} or doctor can choose for me.",
                "24I might also need to take medicine to help me relax and feel sleepy while I wait. I might need to drink the medicine, or the nurse might use my IV to get the medicine. My doctor will know which kind of medicine I need.",
                "25My {{PARENTS-LABEL}} might be able to come with me, but they’ll have to wear a special blue hat, gown, and mask.",
                "26My doctor will let us know if it is ok for my caregiver to come. If my {{PARENTS-LABEL}} does not come with me, my doctors and nurses will take good care of me, and this is ok. I will see my {{PARENTS-LABEL}} when I wake up.",
                "27Once I am feeling relaxed and sleepy, my doctors and nurses will push me on my bed to the room where I will have my surgery.",
                "28Once I am in the room for the surgery, I might need to be moved from my bed on to another table.",
                "29Then the doctors will give me the medicine so that I am asleep for my surgery.",
                "30When my surgery is finished, I will start to wake up. When I wake up, I will be in a different room. My {{PARENTS-LABEL}} will be in the room with me.",
                "31There might be doctors and nurses around to help take care of me and other kids who had surgery too, and it might be busy. This is ok. I will be safe in the new room.",
                "32While I recover, I can choose something fun to do.",
                "33I may even get to have a popsicle or something to drink afterwards.",
                "34I might need to sleep in the hospital after my surgery, so my doctors can check on me. One of my {{PARENTS-LABEL}} can stay with me.",
                "35I might have to stay for one night or I might have to stay for more than one night. My doctors will tell me how long I will need to stay.",
                "36If I need to stay overnight, I will sleep in a bed in the hospital that is different from my bed at home. It has wheels.",
                "37My bed might have machines next to it that help the doctors to learn about my body.",
                "38While I stay at the hospital, I can remember to listen to my nurses and doctors and do what they ask of me. They will help to take good care of me. I can also eat, watch TV, sleep…",
                "39…and play while I stay at the hospital.",
                "40When my doctors say it is ok, I can pack up my things and go home with {{PARENTS-LABEL}}. Everyone will be so proud of me for doing a great job!"
