                "01I am getting ready for my echo. An echo is a picture of my heart. The picture is taken with a small, special camera that glides over my belly and chest. My doctors want to take the picture to learn about how my heart is working.",
                "02First, we will walk from the hospital lobby to the echo waiting area on the 2nd floor of the Farley Building. We will follow the yellow signs with the flower.",
                "03When it is my turn, a nurse will bring me to a changing room. I will take off my shirt, but I can leave my pants on. If I want, I can put on a hospital gown. The gown stays open in the front. My {{PARENTS-LABEL}} can help me put the gown on if I want.",
                "04Then, it will be time for my echo. The echo technologist will come say hello to me. This is the person that will take the pictures.",
                "05The room will need to be dark so the echo technologist can take the pictures.",
                "06The echo technologist will put 3 small, round, white stickers on my chest. The stickers are called leads. The stickers on my chest will be hooked up to the echo machine so it can take the picture. The stickers might feel cool on my chest.",
                "07The technologist will ask me to lie on the bed on the left side of my body.",
                "08The echo technologist will put \"belly jelly\" on the end of the special, small camera. The \"belly jelly\" helps the special camera glide over my belly and chest area. The belly jelly might feel a little warm.",
                "09If I want, I can watch a movie while having my echo. My {{PARENTS-LABEL}} can bring a movie from home. Some kids say watching a movie really helps them during the echo.",
                "10If I want, I can also watch during my echo and see my heart on the computer screen. Some kids like to watch the screen during their echo.",
                "11My job is to stay still during the echo and watch my movie or watch my heart on the screen. I need to stay still so the doctor can get great pictures of my heart. I can remember to stay still during the echo test.",
                "12If I want, {{PARENTS-LABEL}} can lie on the bed on their side with me and give me a hug during the echo test. I will be safe during the test, and my {{PARENTS-LABEL}} will be with me the whole time.",
                "13An echo can take up to 1 hour. When the doctor has all the pictures they need the echo will be finished. The technologist will tell me when the echo is finished.",
                "14The technologist will use a washcloth to wipe off any extra \"belly jelly\" that is left on my belly or chest.",
                "15When I am all done, I can put my shirt back on. Everyone will be so proud of me for doing a great job!"
