                "01I am getting ready for my visit to Boston Children's Hospital. When I get there with my {{PARENTS-LABEL}}, we will walk through the lobby, take a left up the stairs, and go down the hall to the admitting area.",
                "02When we get there, we will talk with someone at the front desk to let them know that we have arrived.",
                "03If they are ready for me, then I can go right upstairs, but if they aren’t ready yet, I might have to wait for a little while. My {{PARENTS-LABEL}} might help me to find something to do while I wait.",
                "04Once they are ready for me, we will follow the purple moon and stars signs to the main building. We will take the elevators to the 9th floor and follow the signs for 9 Northwest.",
                "05Then, we will stop at the desk and let them know that we have arrived.",
                "06If the room is not ready, we might get to spend some time in the activity room.",
                "07When the room is ready, we can go into the room and wait for the nurse or technologist to come say hello.",
                "08My {{PARENTS-LABEL}} might help me put on hospital pajamas or a button down shirt that we brought from home.",
                "09Next, I might meet my nurse. My nurse will help take care of me. I might have a few different nurses while I stay at the hospital.",
                "10The nurse might check my temperature with a thermometer. The nurse might place the thermometer in my mouth or under my arm.",
                "11The nurse might check my blood pressure. She will wrap a piece of cloth around my arm. The cloth will feel tight, like a hug, but this is okay. This is to learn about how my heart is working.",
                "12She might listen to me with her stethoscope. This is to learn about how my heart and lungs are working. The stethoscope might feel a little cold, but this is okay.",
                "13I might also need to step onto a scale to see how tall I am and to see how much I weigh.",
                "14When it is time to get ready for the EEG, I might have to go to a room like this.",
                "15Or, I might have it done in the room that I’m staying in.",
                "16A technologist will arrive with her cart of materials. She will tell me what it is like to have the electrodes (or small gold disks with long colorful wires) placed on my head.",
                "17I might meet the Child Life Specialist. She can find me something fun to do while I have to lay still for my EEG.",
                "18I can also have something special with me that I brought from home.",
                "19First, I will lay flat on the bed with wheels. The technologist will be by my head. I can remember to stay still the whole time so the electrodes don’t move. If it is hard for me to stay still, the technologist might wrap my body in a sheet to help remind me, but this is okay. I will be safe.",
                "20The technologist will use a tape measure to measure my head.",
                "21Next, the technologist will draw dots on my head with a soft crayon to mark where the electrodes will go.",
                "22The technologist will use a Q-tip and soap to rub off the crayon dots. The soap will feel sandy.",
                "23Next, the technologist will place electrodes on my head.",
                "24She will put a small piece of gauze (or soft cloth) on top of each electrode. The cloth will be dipped in special glue. The glue might have a different smell and might feel wet and cold on my head. This is okay.",
                "25Then, she will dry the glue with an air hose that will blow cool wind.",
                "26There are many electrodes that she will need to place on my head. I can ask how many electrodes are left!",
                "27I may even have some on my chest or on my chin! This is okay.",
                "28After the electrodes are on, she will wrap my head with soft gauze and tape.",
                "29Finally, she will put a soft cloth hat on my head to cover the wires.",
                "30The wires attach to a small computer. This is what it will look like.",
                "31The small computer will fit inside a small backpack that I can wear. This is what the backpack will look like.",
                "32I may stay over for one night with my caregiver or I may stay over for a few days. The doctors will decide how long I need to stay at the hospital.",
                "33While I stay at the hospital for the EEG I will have to stay in my room. There will be lots of fun things that I can do, I can ask my child life specialist for some ideas!",
                "34During the EEG, I can also watch movies, eat, sleep, or just hang out and play games.",
                "35When the EEG is over, the technologist will take off my hat and electrodes off with a special glue remover. It will feel cold and wet. Then my hair will be washed with shampoo and a wash cloth.",
                "36The doctors and nurses will tell us when it is time to pack up our things and go home. The nurse will talk to my {{PARENTS-LABEL}}, and my {{PARENTS-LABEL}} will sign some papers.",
                "37I am all done with my EEG and it is time to go home. Everyone is so proud of me!"
