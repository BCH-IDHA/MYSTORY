                "01I am getting ready for my surgery at Boston Children’s Hospital at Lexington. My doctors need to do the surgery to learn about my body or to help me get better.",
                "02I will come to the hospital with my caregivers. I can bring my favorite item from home, like a blanket or a stuffed animal.",
                "03On the day of my surgery and I will not be allowed to eat or drink anything. This might be different, but it is ok. I will eat later, after my surgery.",
                "04I will walk into the Lexington Ambulatory Surgery Building. A sign says Day Surgery. When I see the sign, I know that I am in the right place.",
                "05When we get to the waiting room, we will talk to someone at the front desk. I will meet many different people on the day of my surgery. All of them are there to help me and my family.",
                "06Then we will wait until my name is called. My name might be called right away or I might have to wait a little while. While I wait, my caregiver may help me find something fun to do.",
                "07When my name is called, it will be time to go to a different room, called the Day Surgery Unit. A nurse will bring me and my caregiver to this new room.",
                "08This room may be busy with people, like doctors and nurses. There are beds and chairs, and I may see other kids waiting for surgery like me.",
                "09The nurse will ask me to stand on a scale. The nurse will measure my height and weight.",
                "10The nurse will put a bracelet on my arm with my name and birthday. Now the doctor knows what my name is when I am having surgery.",
                "11Then, I will sit on a stretcher. The stretcher looks like a long bed with wheels.",
                "12While I am sitting, the nurse will gently place something on my finger. It’s called a pulse oximeter. It will measure the oxygen in my body.",
                "13The nurse will check my temperature with a thermometer. The nurse might touch the thermometer to my head, or the side of my face by my ear. It might tickle, but that is okay!",
                "14The nurse will check my blood pressure to learn about my heart. The nurse will wrap a piece of cloth around my arm. The cloth will give my arm a hug, but that is okay.",
                "15Next, the nurse will listen to my heart and lungs with a stethoscope. The stethoscope might feel a little cold, but that is okay. This is to learn more about how my heart and lungs are working.",
                "16It’s time to put on hospital pajamas! They look like a long shirt that opens in the back. My caregivers can help me put the hospital pajamas on if I need help.",
                "17I will meet my anesthesiologist, this is the Doctor who will help me fall asleep and stay asleep during the surgery.",
                "18A clear soft mask like this will help me fall asleep. My anesthesiologist might let me pick the flavor of the mask. It’s fun to choose from all the different flavors! If I want, my parent can help me decide.",
                "19Now I wait for my surgery. I can take deep breaths to help me feel calm. While I am waiting a nice person might bring me a fun activity to do.",
                "20While I wait for my surgery, I might need to take medicine to help me relax. I might drink this medicine.",
                "21Soon it will be time for my surgery. My doctors and nurses will push my bed to the room where I will have my surgery. My caregiver is able to come with me. They will have to wear a special gown and a paper hat.",
                "22Once I am in the room for the surgery, I might need to be moved from my bed onto another bed. It will be time to breath through the soft, clear mask. I will fall asleep.",
                "23When my surgery is finished, I will stop getting anesthesia, the sleeping medicine, and I will start to wake up. When I wake up, I will be in a different room. The room might be busy with doctors and nurses, who will take care of me and other kids who had surgery. I will be safe in the new room.",
                "24When I wake up I may have a small, bendy straw in my hand called an IV. This gives me medicine while I sleep. The nurse will take the small, bendy straw out and put a Band-Aid on my hand before I go home.",
                "25Before I go home, I can have a Popsicle or juice.",
                "26When my nurses say it is okay, I can go home! I may feel a little sleepy, and that’s okay. Someone can give me a ride in wheelchair to the car. I will get stickers for being so brave. At home I will rest till I’m feeling better. Everyone will be so proud of me for doing a great job!",
