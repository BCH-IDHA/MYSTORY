                "01I am getting ready for my EKG at Boston Childrenâ€™s Hospital. An EKG takes a picture of my heart. My doctors want to take the picture to learn how my heart is working.",
                "02When it is time for the EKG, a nurse will come into my room and say hello to me and my parents.  This is the person who will take pictures of my heart.  My parents can stay with me the whole time during the EKG.",
                "03The nurse will bring an EKG machine, which looks like a small computer on a stand with wheels.",
                "04We will walk to the front desk and stand very still while my {{PARENTS-LABEL}} tells the front desk worker we have arrived. Then we will wait until I hear someone say my name.",
                "05The nurse might ask me and my parents some questions.  They might ask to see my name bracelet, too.",
                "06I will have to lie down flat on the hospital bed to have the EKG.",
                "07When I am lying down, the nurse will place 13 small stickers called electrodes on my chest, back, arms, legs, and shoulders.",
                "08These stickers are connected by tiny wires to a machine that looks like a small computer on a stand with wheels.",
                "09My job is to stay still for a very short time while the EKG machine takes pictures of my heart. I can remember to stay still during the EKG.",
                "10During the EKG, the computer will print out a piece of paper with squiggly lines on it that tells the doctor about my heart.",
                "11When the EKG is finished, the nurse will take the stickers off of my body. I can help her take the stickers off, take the stickers off myself, or have my mom or dad help me take the stickers off.",
                "12The stickers are really sticky, and they might hurt a little bit when we take them off my body, but I will be okay.  The nurse has some special wipes that can be put on the stickers to help them come off my skin more easily.",
		        "13When all of the stickers are gone, the EKG is over.  Everyone will be so proud of me for doing such a great job!"
