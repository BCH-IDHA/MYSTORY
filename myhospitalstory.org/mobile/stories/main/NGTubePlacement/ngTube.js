                "01Today I am getting my NG-Tube placed.",
                "02The nurse will bring me to the treatment room or make me comfortable in my bed.",
                "03The nurse may put a small piece of tan tape on my cheek for the NG-Tube to rest on later. This may feel funny, but that is okay.",
                "04The nurse will set up all of the supplies on a table next to me. I may see scissors, but they will not touch me.",
                "05The nurse will hold a long rubber tube by my nose, wrap it around my ear, and gently press on my belly to measure how long the tube needs to be.",
                "06My nurse will ask me to hold my body still, and keep my hands at my sides. My parents will be in the room with me so they can help hold my hands still.",
                "07The nurse may ask other nurses to come and help hold my body still to keep me safe. They may lightly hold my arms, head or legs.",
                "08The nurse will take the long rubber tube they measured on me before and begin to place it in my nose. There will be some gooey lotion on the tube to help it slide in my nose easily.",
                "09As the nurse puts the tube into my nose I will begin to feel it in the back of my throat. This will feel different and may feel funny, but that is okay.",
                "10The nurse may ask me to take sips of water or juice.  This will help the tube find its way to my belly. It may feel funny to drink, but it is safe even when I can feel the tube in my throat.",
                "11When the tube is in the right place in my throat and belly, the nurse will tape the tube to my cheek so it doesn’t move around.",
                "12My nurse may attach a small syringe to the end of the tube to make sure it is in the right spot; the syringe will not touch my skin, just the tube.",
                "13When the tube is in place, the nurse may bring me to the X-ray room.  An X-ray picture is a picture that can see the inside of my body.  The picture will let the nurse know the tube is in the correct place in my body.",
                "14Everyone will be so proud of me when I am finished!"
