                "01Sometimes I will need to get an I.V.",
                "02An I.V. is a small, bendy straw that my nurse will use to give me medicine to help my body. The I.V. is placed into a vein inside a part of my body like my arm, hand, or foot. This is what it will look like.",
                "03The nurse will connect the small, bendy straw to a tube. My medicine will go through the tube from a machine like this.",
                "04Before I get my I.V., my nurse and parents will make sure I am comfortable. Maybe my nurse will have me sit up. It will be important that keep my body still.",
                "05When it is time to get my I.V., a nurse will put a stretchy band around my arm. The stretchy band might feel tight, but that is okay. It is tight to help my nurse see my veins.",
                "06I will keep my body very still. Another nurse might gently hold my arm, hand, or foot still to remind me to not move my body.",
                "07My nurse will use a special wipe to clean the part of my body where the I.V. will go. The wipe might feel wet and cold. It might smell different too.",
                "08When it is clean, my nurse will be ready to place the I.V. I can ask my nurse to count to 3 so I can get ready too. I can choose to watch, or I can choose to look away.",
                "09Then, my nurse will place the I.V. The small, bendy straw has a needle inside of it. The needle will not stay in my arm and my nurse will take it right out. The small, bendy straw will stay in my arm, hand, or foot.",
                "10My nurse will place tape over the small straw to make sure it stays in the right place.",
                "11My nurse might cover my I.V. This is to help keep it in place.",
                "12When we are finished, my nurse will connect a tube to my new I.V. This is how I get my medicine.",
                "13My nurse will be so happy that I kept still. Now I can get my medicine to help my body.",
                "14When I am getting ready to go home, the nurse will uncover my I.V., take the tape off, and slide the small, bendy straw out. I will not need this when I go home. When she is done, I can have a Band-Aid. Everyone will be so proud of me for doing a good job with my I.V.!"
