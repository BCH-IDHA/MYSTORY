                "01I am getting ready to go to the dentist at Boston Childrenâ€™s Hospital.",
                "02I will take the elevator to the first floor.",
                "03Then, I will follow the orange signs to Dentistry.",
                "04We will take another elevator up to the 4th floor of the Hunnewell building.",
                "05I will see a door that says \"Welcome to Dentistry\".",
                "06Next, we will check in at the front desk.  I will remember to wait nicely and keep my body still.",
                "07We will wait until my name is called.  We might wait for a long time or we might wait for a short time.  I can play with toys or read books while we wait.",
                "08When my name is called, we will walk down a hallway to a new room.",
                "09When I get to the room, I will sit in the big chair.  My parent can sit next to me the whole time.  The dentist might ask my parent some questions.",
                "10The dentist will show me how the chair moves up and down.  It will even lay all the way back.  I can remember that I am safe when the chair moves.",
                "11The dentist will put on a mask and gloves to keep everything clean.",
                "12Next, the dentist will place a big piece of paper around my neck to keep my clothes clean.  The dentist might also give me sunglasses to wear so the light is less bright.",
		        "13Then, the dentist will show me the teeth counter and the mirror.  I might even get to touch them.",
		        "14I will open my mouth really big so the dentist can count my teeth.",
		        "15Next, the dentist will brush my teeth using a special toothbrush.  It will make a buzzing noise and vibrates a little, but it is gentle.  The dentist will let me feel it first so I know what it will feel like in my mouth.",
		        "16I might get to choose what kind of toothpaste I want.  There are lots of flavors to choose from!  The dentist might let me smell it first too.",
		        "17The dentist will start brushing my teeth with the special brush and the toothpaste.  The brush might feel funny in my mouth, but this is ok.",
		        "18The dentist may use a special straw to clean the toothpaste out of my mouth.  I can also feel this first.  I might feel the straw pulling water from my mouth.",
		        "19Next, the dentist may use a tiny brush to brush my teeth with vitamins.",
		        "20I will open my mouth wide to floss my teeth.  The floss is soft.  The dentist will place the floss between each tooth.  I will keep my mouth open to get the spaces in between my teeth clean.",
		        "21The dentist might also use a tiny hose to squirt water into my mouth.  This might feel cold and wet, but this is ok.",
		        "22Now my teeth are clean!  The dentist will move the chair so I can sit up.  Everyone will be so proud of me for doing such a good job at the dentist!"
