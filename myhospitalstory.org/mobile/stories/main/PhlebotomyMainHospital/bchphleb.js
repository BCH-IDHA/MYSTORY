                "03First we will follow the signs with the blue fish. Then we will take an elevator to the 1st floor.",

                "05When we get to the lab, my {{PARENTS-LABEL}} will talk to someone at the front desk.",
                "06Now we will sit down and wait. We might wait for a few minutes, or we might wait for a long time.",
                "07While I am waiting, I can read a book, play with a toy, or sit quietly. My {{PARENTS-LABEL}} can help me to find something to do while I wait.",
                "08When my name is called I will leave the waiting room and walk back to a small room.",
                "09I will meet a lab technician who might look like this. My lab technician will talk to me about having a test on my arm. My lab technician might also ask me questions, like my name and my birthday.",

                "12My lab technician will show me a blue stretchy band. The blue stretchy band will be tied on my arm.",
                "13The band will feel tight on my arm like a hug. This is ok because it is good for the band to hug my arm tight.",
                "14My lab technician will touch my arm with his/her finger to make sure my arm is ready for the test. I will need to keep my arm very still while my lab technician touches my arm.",
                "15Next, my lab technician will wash my arm with a small, wet pad. It might be cold and it might have a smell. I will keep my arm very still while my arm is washed.",
                "16Now it is time to start the test on my arm. It is important that I hold my arm very still for my test. Someone might help hold my arm still.The Doctor will look in my nose with a special light.",
                "17Now we will count to 3 and then I will feel a tiny pinch in my arm.",
                "18I can be very brave by taking big breaths and asking my {{PARENTS-LABEL}} for a hug while I keep my arm very still. I can also talk about something fun and remember the tiny pinch will be over very soon.",             
                "19It is ok to move my head or talk during my arm test, but I should keep my body very still.",

                "21Next, my lab technician will put a small piece of cloth on top of where I had my test.",
                "22Lastly, I will get a bandage on my arm where I had my test.",
