                "01I am getting ready to go to the doctor. During my visit the doctor will learn about my body to help keep me healthy.",
                "02We will walk to the clinic and we will talk to someone at the front desk and wait until my name is called. My name might be called right away or I might have to wait a little while. While I am waiting, I can do a quiet activity. Mom or Dad can help me to find something to do while I wait.",
                "03When it is my turn, a clinical assistant, the person who tells the doctor how much I’m growing, will call my name and bring me to a room. The clinical assistant will ask my parents some questions.",
                "04The clinical assistant will measure how much I weigh. The clinical assistant will ask me to stand on a scale. Maybe I will need to take my shoes off and that’s okay. I can remember to stand very still while the CA reads the number on the scale.",
                "05The clinical assistant will also measure how tall I am. I can stand nice and tall against the wall and I might feel a tap on my head.",
                "06Then the clinical assistant will ask me to sit on a chair and she will take my blood pressure by wrapping a piece of cloth around my arm. The cloth will feel very tight but this is ok. This is to learn about how my heart is working.",
                "07Next, I will look at a paper from far away and tell the clinical assistant what I see. The paper might have shapes or letters on it. I will cover one eye at a time with my hand and I will tell her what objects I see.",
                "08Finally, the clinical assistant might bring us to another room or I might have to go back to the waiting room. Everyone will be so proud of me when my vitals are done!",
