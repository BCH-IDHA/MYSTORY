                "01I am getting ready for my EKG at Boston Childrenâ€™s Hospital. An EKG takes a picture of my heart. My doctors want to take the picture to learn how my heart is working.",
                "02First, we will walk into the lobby and take the elevator to the 2nd floor.",
                "03We will follow the yellow signs to the cardiology clinic.",
                "04We will walk to the front desk and stand very still while my {{PARENTS-LABEL}} tells the front desk worker we have arrived. Then we will wait until I hear someone say my name.",
                "05When it is my turn we will go to a different room with the EKG machine.",
                "06When it is time for the EKG I will have to lie down flat.",
                "07When I am lying down, the nurse will place 13 small stickers called electrodes on my chest, back, arms, legs, and shoulders.",
                "08These stickers are connected by tiny wires to a machine that looks like a small computer on wheels.",
                "09My job is to stay still for a very short time while the EKG machine takes pictures of my heart. I can remember to keep my body still.",
                "10During the EKG, the computer will print out a piece of paper with squiggly lines on it that tells the doctor about my heart.",
                "11When the EKG is finished, the Clinical Assistant will take the stickers off of my body. I can help her take the stickers off, take the stickers off myself, or have my parent help to take the stickers off.",
                "12When all of the stickers are gone, the EKG is over, and I can get ready to go. Everyone will be so proud of me for doing a great job!"
