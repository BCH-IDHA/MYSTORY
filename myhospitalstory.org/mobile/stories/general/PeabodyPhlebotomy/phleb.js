                "01Today I am going to Boston Children’s at Peabody for blood work. Sometimes I will need to get blood work to help my doctor take care of me.",
                "02I will walk into the lobby.",
                "03I can take the elevators or the stairs to the 2nd floor.",
                "04I will go to the waiting room through the big glass doors.",
                "05I may need to wait in line to talk with someone at the front desk to let the lab know I am here.",
                "06We will sit down and wait. We might wait for a few minutes, or we might wait for a long time. While I am waiting, I can read a book, check out the fish tank, or sit quietly. {{PARENTS-LABEL}} can help me to find something to do while I wait.",
                "07When my name is called, it is our turn to walk back to our room. I will meet a lab technician in the room. The lab technician will talk with me and ask me some questions, like my name and my birthday.",
                "08I will sit in the chair in the room. I might sit on{{PARENTS-LABEL}}'s lap. {{PARENTS-LABEL}} might also stand next to me while I sit. It’s ok to ask {{PARENTS-LABEL}} to hug me.",
                "09The lab technician will show me a blue stretchy band that will hug my arm. First, she will tie the band on my arm. Then, she will touch my arm with her finger.",
                "10The lab technician will wash my arm with a small, wet pad. It might be cold and it might smell a little.",
                "11There are lots of things I can do while they do the lab draw. I can count 1..2..3 or say the ABC’s, sing a song or squeeze a ball, we may have even more ideas!",
                "12We will count to 3 and I will feel a tiny pinch in my. It’s ok to move my head, but I need to try very hard not to move my body during the test on my arm. It’s also ok to make a noise if I am feeling scared.",
                "13Next, the lab technician may use pressure to hold a small piece of cloth on top of where I had my blood test.",
                "14After this is done, I can have a band-aid if I want, but I don’t have to. This means I am done. On the way out of the lab, I can get a sticker, from the desk where we checked in, if I want to. {{PARENTS-LABEL}} and my lab friends will be proud of me for doing a good job with the test on my arm."
