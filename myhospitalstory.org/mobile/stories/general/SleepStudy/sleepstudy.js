                "01I am getting ready for my sleep study at Boston Childrenâ€™s Hospital so that my doctors can learn more about my body.",
                "02I will arrive at the hospital with my caregiver. We will stop at the main lobby desk. They will give us a badge and tell us how to get to the 9th floor.",
                "03We will take the elevator to the 9th floor.",
                "04We will follow the orange signs to the Sleep Lab.",
                "05I will meet a sleep technologist. The sleep tech will help me check in. They might also ask me questions, like my name and my birthday.",
                "06The sleep tech will show me the room where I will be sleeping. It might look like this. I can bring some toys from home if I want.",
                "07My caregiver will stay in the room with me too. They will sleep on a bed that looks like this.",
                "08The sleep tech will have me step onto a scale to see how much I weigh. I will stand very still.",
                "09The sleep tech will also need to see how tall I am. I will stand very still and a measuring stick will gently touch the top of my head!,",
                "10They will also need to check my blood pressure to learn about how my heart is working. The tech will do this by wrapping a piece of cloth around my arm. This cloth will feel tight, but this is OK.",
                "11The tech will tell me about my sleep study and answer any questions I have.",
                "12My {{PARENTS-LABEL}} will help me put on my pajamas.",
                "13When it is time to get ready for the sleep study I will sit in a chair. The tech will tell me what it is like to have electrodes (small disks with long colorful wires) placed on my head.",
                "14First the sleep tech will measure my head with a tape measure.",
                "15The tech will draw dots on my head with a soft crayon to mark where the electrodes will go.",
                "16The tech will use a Q-tip and soap to rub off the crayon dots. The soap will feel sandy. Then the tech will place electrodes (small gold discs with colorful wires) on my head.",
                "17The tech will use special tape to help the electrodes stay in place. While he/she is placing the electrodes on my head I can look at a toy or watch a movie.",
                "18The tech will also place a small flexible tube on my face. This tube will rest under my nose to check my breathing.",
                "19After the electrodes are on, the sleep tech will wrap my head with soft gauze.",
                "20I will get ready for bed. I will do my night time activities, like brushing my teeth, reading a book, or holding my stuffed animal.",
                "21The tech will place a sticker with a red light on my finger, called a pulse oximeter. This sticker helps to check how fast my heart is beating.",
                "22Now it is time to go to sleep. Once I am asleep the sleep tech might come in to check the electrodes. This is OK, I am safe and can go back to sleep.",
                "23In the morning I will wake up and the sleep tech will take off the electrodes using special shampoo. The shampoo might smell funny, but it will make my head clean again.",
                "24I am all done with my sleep study. Everyone will be so proud of me for doing a great job!"
