                "01I am getting ready for my visit to Boston Children's Hospital. When I get there with my parents, we will walk into the lobby, take a left and take the elevator to the 9th floor.",
                "02Next we will walk to the front desk and stand very still while my {{PARENTS-LABEL}} tells the front desk worker we have arrived. Then we will wait until I hear someone call my name.",
                "03When it is time for my EEG, a technologist will bring us to a different room.",
                "04The technologist will have me lie down on the bed.",
                "05The technologist is the person that will help with the EEG. He/she will explain how the EEG works and then we can start!",
                "06First, the technologist will measure my head with a tape measure. I will keep my body very still.",
                "07Next, the technologist will draw dots on my head with a soft crayon to mark where the electrodes will go.",
                "08The technologist will use a Q-tip and soap to rub off the crayon dots. The soap will feel sandy.",
                "09Next, the technologist will place electrodes (small gold discs with colorful wires) on my head.",
                "10While he/she is putting the electrodes on my head, I can look at my toy or watch a movie. I can remember to stay still the whole time so the electrodes donâ€™t move.",
                "11The technologist will use special tape to help the electrodes stay in place.",
                "12After the electrodes are on, the technologist will wrap my head with soft gauze.",
                "13I will lie down on the bed and my {{PARENTS-LABEL}} can stay with me. I can sleep, look at my toy, or watch a movie during the EEG.",
                "14If it is hard for me to stay still on my own, the technologist might wrap my body in a sheet to help remind me, but this is ok. I will be safe.",
                "15When I lay still the camera and computer will learn about my brain. I will need to be still and calm, I can ask my technologist how long I need to rest.",
                "16The technologist will also have me blow into a pinwheel.",
                "17The technologist will ask me to look at a flashing light. He or she might ask me to open and close my eyes.",
                "18When the EEG is over, the technologist will take off the electrodes using special shampoo.",
                "19The shampoo might smell funny, but it will make my head clean again.",
                "20I am all done with my EEG. Everyone will be so proud of me for keeping my body calm and following directions."
