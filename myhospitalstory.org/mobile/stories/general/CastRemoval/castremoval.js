                "02First, the doctors will cut the hard part of the cast with a special saw. The saw will not touch my skin or hurt me, but it might tickle.",
                "03The saw might be loud. If the saw is too loud, I can listen to music or even look at a book.",
                "04My {{PARENTS-LABEL}} can stay with me the whole time while the doctor removes my cast.",
                "05After the doctors cut the hard part of my cast, they can use special tools called pliers and scissors to help take it off.",
                "06Next, they will cut the softer part of my cast, and take that off, too. I can remember to keep my body very still.",
                "07Once the cast is off I will finally see my arm that was covered with the cast. It might look different than it did before. The skin might be dry or pale and my arm might look smaller too.",
                "08I will not worry, because I know that my bone is better, and soon my arm will get strong and look the same as it did before. The doctor might give me some special exercises to do to help my arm get stronger.",
                "09After we are finished talking with the doctor, I am all done and I can go home! Everyone will be so proud of me for doing a great job getting my cast off!"
